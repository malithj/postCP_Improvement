This vignette documents the mechanism provided in postCP 2.0. The document will first explain the theoretical basis and it will move on to explain the usage of the package. 

##change-point problem
The postCP Package is based on the change point model 
$$
\boldsymbol y[I_k] \sim \boldsymbol X[I_k] \times \boldsymbol \beta^k
$$ 
where $\textbf{y} \in \mathbb{R} ^{n\times d}$ is the response variable and $\textbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ is the covariate matrix. The response variable is generated with $K>1$ segments according to any Generalized Linear Model (ex: Gaussian or binomial regressions). 

$I_k = [cp_{kâˆ’1} + 1, cp_k ]$ is the index of the individuals of the k th segment, and with the convention that
$cp_0 = 0$ and that $cp_K = n$

### Posterior change-point distribution
For a given parameter $\boldsymbol \theta$, our objective is to compute the posterior change-point distribution:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\textbf{cp} | \boldsymbol y,\boldsymbol X ; \boldsymbol \theta)
$$
or, equivalently, the posterior segmentation distribution:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\boldsymbol S | \boldsymbol y,\boldsymbol X ; \boldsymbol \theta)
$$

The posterior distributions are calculated through a constrained HMM (Hidden Markov Model) coded in C++ with the aim of achieving efficiency in computations.
